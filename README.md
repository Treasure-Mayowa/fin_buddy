## Problem
Financial literacy remains critically low in Nigeria and across Africa, with millions lacking access to quality financial advice. Traditional financial advisory services are:

- Expensive: High consultation fees exclude low-income populations
- Inaccessible: Limited physical presence in rural and underserved areas
- Complex: Technical jargon creates barriers for everyday users
- Not Localized: Generic advice doesn't address individual financial contexts and challenges

The result? Poor financial decisions, lack of investment knowledge, and perpetual financial insecurity for millions of Africans.
